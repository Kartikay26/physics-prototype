====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Kartikay26/physics-prototype.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Kartikay26/physics-prototype)

This is a very simple physics simulation written in python. It uses the
Forward Euler method for the simulations. The main code is in physics.py,
it can be used as a library in other python programs.
